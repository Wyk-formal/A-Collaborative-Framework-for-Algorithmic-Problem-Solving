## ⚠️ Important Notice

**TL;DR: Use `main.py` for algorithm solving. The engineering version is incomplete.**

**This project is currently in development. The engineering version is still under development and cannot be used yet. Please use the original `main.py` file for algorithm problem solving.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using the Original Version (Recommended)

This project is based on a single `main.py` file implementation, containing complete RAG algorithm solving functionality.

#### Environment Setup

1. **Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Start Neo4j Database**

This project provides a pre-configured Neo4j Docker container with complete OI WIKI algorithm data.

**Option A: Use Pre-packaged Database (Recommended)**

```bash
cd neo4j-dump-deploy
docker compose up -d
```

**Note**: Ensure `dumps/neo4j.dump` exists for first-time import. If you've run before and generated `neo4j/data`, the script will skip import. To force re-import, run `make clean` first.

**Option B: Download Database from Releases**

```bash
cd neo4j-dump-deploy
scripts/get_dump.sh "<RELEASE_ASSET_URL>" neo4j.dump
docker compose up -d
```

**Access Neo4j:**

- Browser Interface: http://localhost:7474
- Bolt Connection: `bolt://localhost:7687`
- Default Credentials: `neo4j / passcode123` (please change password after first login)
- Neo4j Version: 5.26.10

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Modify the following configuration in the `main.py` file:

```python
# API Configuration
ZHIPU_API_KEY = "your_zhipu_api_key_here"  # Replace with your ZhipuAI API key

# Neo4j Database Configuration (use default configuration)
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "passcode123"  # Or your modified password
```

#### Usage

Run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

After startup, the program will display two options:

```
Please select mode:
1. Enter problem directly in terminal
2. Read problem from MD document and output to MD document
Please enter your choice (1 or 2):
```

**Mode 1: Interactive Input**

- Enter algorithm problems directly in the terminal
- System will analyze and generate solutions in real-time
- Supports code validation and optimization

**Mode 2: File Processing**

- Write problem content to `input.md` file
- System reads and processes the problem
- Results output to `output.md` file

### Example Usage

#### Interactive Mode Example

```bash
python main.py
# Select mode 1
# Input problem:
# Please implement quicksort algorithm and analyze its time complexity
```

#### File Processing Mode Example

1. Create `input.md` file:

```markdown
# P1001 A+B Problem

## Problem Description

Input two integers a and b, output the value of a+b.

## Input Format

One line, two integers a and b.

## Output Format

One line, the value of a+b.

## Sample Input

1 2

## Sample Output

3
```

2. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
# Select mode 2
```

3. View results:

The program will generate a complete solution in the `output.md` file, including:

- Problem analysis
- Algorithm approach
- C++ code implementation
- Complexity analysis
- Code validation results

## 🚧 Engineering Version Status

**Note: The engineering version is still under development with incomplete functionality. Not recommended for use.**

The engineering version includes the following modules (under development):

- `src/` - Modular source code
- `web/` - Web visualization interface
- `cli/` - Command line tools
- `docker/` - Containerized deployment

**Current Status:**

- ❌ Web Interface: Partially functional but has stability issues
- ❌ CLI Tools: Incomplete interface
- ❌ Modular Code: Some modules missing
- ❌ Docker Deployment: Incomplete configuration

**Recommendations:**

- Use the original `main.py` file for algorithm solving
- Wait for the engineering version to be completed before using new features

## 🗄️ Neo4j Database Management

### Database Deployment

This project uses a Docker containerized Neo4j database with complete OI WIKI algorithm data.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Enter database deployment directory
cd neo4j-dump-deploy

# Start database (using pre-packaged data)
docker compose up -d

# Optional: Override NEO4J_AUTH via .env file
# Create .env in neo4j-dump-deploy/ with: NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/your_password
# Then run: docker compose up -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

#### Database Management Commands

```bash
# Stop database
cd neo4j-dump-deploy
make down

# Restart database
make down && make up

# Clean data (use with caution)
make clean

# View logs
make logs
```

#### Database Access

- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:7474
- **Bolt Connection**: `bolt://localhost:7687`
- **Default Credentials**: `neo4j / passcode123`
- **Database Version**: Neo4j 5.26.10

#### Data Validation

After startup, you can validate data through the following methods:

```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# View data loading logs
# macOS/Linux:
docker compose logs neo4j -f --tail=200 | grep -m1 "Load OK"
# Windows (PowerShell):
docker compose logs neo4j -f --tail=200 | findstr "Load OK"

# Access through browser at http://localhost:7474
# Login with default credentials and check data node count
```

### Data Backup and Recovery

```bash
# Create data backup (Neo4j 5.x, OFFLINE)
cd neo4j-dump-deploy

# 1) Stop service to ensure offline operation
docker compose down

# 2) Use one-time container for offline export (mount data/logs/dumps)
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/neo4j/data:/data" \
  -v "$PWD/neo4j/logs:/logs" \
  -v "$PWD/dumps:/out" \
  neo4j:5.26.10 \
  bash -lc '/var/lib/neo4j/bin/neo4j-admin database dump neo4j --to-path=/out --overwrite-destination'
# Backup is now at ./dumps/neo4j.dump

# 3) Restart service if needed
docker compose up -d


# Restore from backup (OFFLINE)
cd neo4j-dump-deploy

# 1) Stop service to ensure offline operation
docker compose down

# 2) Use one-time container for offline restore (load from ./dumps/)
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/neo4j/data:/data" \
  -v "$PWD/neo4j/logs:/logs" \
  -v "$PWD/dumps:/imports" \
  neo4j:5.26.10 \
  bash -lc '/var/lib/neo4j/bin/neo4j-admin database load neo4j --from-path=/imports --overwrite-destination'

# 3) Start service
docker compose up -d
```

**Alternative for simple restore**: If you only want to use the built-in auto-import script, the process is simpler: place `neo4j.dump` in `neo4j-dump-deploy/dumps/`, then run `make clean && docker compose up -d` (first startup will auto-load, subsequent starts will skip).

**Note**: The "offline one-time container" approach above is suitable for precise controllable backup/restore operations and avoids the risk of executing admin commands on running instances.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Neo4j Connection Failed**

   ```
   Solutions:
   - Check if Docker service is running: docker --version
   - Check Neo4j container status: cd neo4j-dump-deploy && docker compose ps
   - View container logs: cd neo4j-dump-deploy && docker compose logs
   - Confirm port is not occupied:
     # macOS/Linux:
     lsof -i :7687
     # Windows (PowerShell):
     Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 7687).OwningProcess
   ```

2. **Neo4j Database Loading Failed**

   ```
   Solutions:
   - Check if dump file exists: ls neo4j-dump-deploy/dumps/
   - Reload database: cd neo4j-dump-deploy && make clean && docker compose up -d
   - Check if disk space is sufficient
   ```

3. **API Call Failed**

   ```
   Solution: Check if ZHIPU_API_KEY is correct and network connection is normal
   ```

4. **Code Compilation Failed**

   ```
   Solution: Ensure g++ or clang++ compiler is installed on the system
   ```

5. **Dependency Installation Failed**

   ```
   Solution: Use conda or pip to install packages in requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Docker File Sharing Issues (macOS)**
   ```
   Solution: If Docker cannot read/write ./dumps or ./neo4j/data directories,
   go to Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → File Sharing and add this project path.
   ```
